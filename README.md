# Click Through Rate Analysis and Prediction

This project involves analyzing a dataset related to ad interactions on a website. The goal is to gain insights into click-through rates based on user characteristics and behaviors, and to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a user will click on an ad or not.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing user information and ad interaction data to understand the click-through rates based on various factors. The main steps include:

1. Data loading and preprocessing.
2. Analyzing click-through rates based on user attributes like age, income, time spent on site, etc.
3. Calculating the overall click-through rate (CTR).
4. Training a machine learning model to predict whether a user will click on an ad.

## Data Analysis

The dataset is explored to understand the relationship between user attributes and click-through rates. Box plots are used to visualize this relationship based on different features such as age, income, daily time spent on the site, and more.

## Click Through Rate Prediction Model

A machine learning model is trained using the Random Forest classification algorithm to predict whether a user will click on an ad. Relevant features such as age, daily time spent on site, area income, etc., are used for training.

## Usage

To predict click-through rates using the trained model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Run the provided Python script (`click_through_rate_prediction.py`).
4. Input the required features (daily time spent on site, age, area income, etc.).
5. The script will output whether the user is likely to click on the ad.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohshaikh23/Ads-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd click-through-rate-analysis
```

3. Run the prediction script:

```bash
python click_through_rate_prediction.py
```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- plotly

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```
